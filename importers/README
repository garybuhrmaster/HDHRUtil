    MythTV           - Import MythTV recordings

                       Note: For many/most cases, file
                       ownership/permissions will need to
                       be adjusted after import unless one
                       runs the import under the recording
                       engine userid.

                       Note: Run the MythTV find_orphans.py
                       script first to clean/validate your
                       MythTV database.  Missing files
                       will throw errors and terminate the
                       import.
